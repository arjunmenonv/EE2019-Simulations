# EE2019-Simulations
LTSpice Simulations of Analog Blocks used in EE2019 Analog Systems Lab (Spring 2020)

**This repository contains the LTSpice files (.asc format) and associated analysis (scanned notes) for the following blocks:**
- Bandpass Filter
- Peak detector

**The Lab involved assembly of the following analog blocks used in a Synchronised LED and Speaker Analog System:**
- DC-DC buck converter based LED Driver
- Class D Amplifier
- Schmitt Trigger Oscillator
- Bandpass Filter 
- Adder and Peak Detector

The images of the assembled circuit have been added to thius repository under the directory '\imgs'
